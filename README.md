# Centurion Mission (Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes) Archipelago Manual
Built upon Manual Stable [v20250714](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual/releases/tag/manual_stable_20250714)


## Prerequisites
You will need a copy of [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/) and the mod [Centurion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=952828429).
It is recommended to have the mod [Tweaks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1366808675) downloaded as well and enable zen mode while playing.

## Items
- Each modded module on the bomb is an item. You need to receive that module's item in order to interact with it.
- My recommended method of playing is that you cannot start trying to solve a module until you receive its item.

## Locations
- Each module solved on the bomb is a location. Souvenir and Forget Me Not are required items but not locations.
- Turn the Keys is not a location either due to settings.
- Goal is to solve the whole bomb.

## Options
- number_of_starting_modules: If you are playing a mission with Turn The Keys, ignore this. Otherwise use this to choose how many starting modules you want.
- start_with_ttks_modules: If you are playing a mission with Turn The Keys, this should be enabled. If you play a bomb with TTKs and this module disabled, the bomb will likely become impossible.
- enable_ttk_check: If you want Turn The Key to give a check. I recommend to leave this option off and use cheat console to solve TTK and ignore it.
- enable_3rd_vanilla: Turn this option on if playing the "No Needy Centurion" which has 3 vanilla modules. If you're playing the standard Centurion with a needy, leave this off.

## How to Play
- Installing the .apworld, generating a YAML and connecting via the manual client is the same as normal.
- Open Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes with mods installed.
- Enable Zen Mode in tweaks settings.
- Start the Centurion, No Needy Centurion or local mission depending on your preferences.
- Start completing modules that are available, either as a team or EFM (solo).
